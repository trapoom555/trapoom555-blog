# Insights
- In order to achieve few-shot learning capabilities, the model needs to be trained on a very large dataset.
- designing the model which can be easily feed on large-scale data can take the advantage of large-scale and perform SOTA


# Idea
1. Frozen : Instead of image we can train vdo? and output robot action (FLAMINGO did it !)
2. In context learning are very costly at inference, we can't use in robotics
3. Flamingo uses a very dense architecture. Can we replace the FFN to something like Mixture of Experts to increase the efficiency.
4. Can I apply Few-shot learning to the imitation learning ?
