- Multimodal prompt (Text / Image)
- output motor actuation autoregressively
- Robot agent with zero-shot generalization
- develop new simulation benchmark VIMA-Bench (600K+ expert trajectories)
    - RGB images (frontal view and top-down view), Bounding-box, Segmentation
    - High level action space (pick & place, wipe)
- This benchmark aims to measure zero-shot capabilities
